**Notes**

- Some USB devices are problematic with SmoothWAN built-in USB network adapter renamer (the unique name shown in the example as `USB_1f16`), you can disable this option in Speedify navigation menu -> Options. The adapter naming will be named by the order of first detection e.g `usb0`, `usb1` which can be random on every power up. 
For data limited users, Speedify won't be able to tell which USB connected adapter corresponds to the set data limits and statistcs.
