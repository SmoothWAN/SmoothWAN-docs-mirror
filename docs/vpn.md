## Tunneling all clients to a VPN over Speedify/Engarde/TinyFEC
**Experimental**

Setup your VPN as you would in any OpenWrt router, many VPN providers provide instructions for OpenWrt.

??? note "WireGuard VPN example"

    "A screenshot is worth a thousand words".

    Cloudflare WARP VPN example:

    ![](assets/vpn/2.webp){: style="max-height:700px;border:6px solid #d2ccf1;"}
    ![](assets/vpn/3.webp){: style="max-height:700px;border:6px solid #d2ccf1;"}
    ![](assets/vpn/4.webp){: style="max-height:700px;border:6px solid #d2ccf1;"}

??? note "WireGuard extra steps for SmoothWAN v0.99.9"
    There is currently an issue with OpenWrt `netifd` allowing WireGuard to bypass Speedify and bind to the first WAN up & not following the routing tables...

    The current workaround is to use firewall markings.

    1. Add a firewall marking by going to *Network* -> *Firewall* -> *Traffic Rules* -> *Add*
    ![](assets/vpn/1e.webp){: style="max-height:700px;border:6px solid #d2ccf1;"}
    3. Add an IP rule by going to *Network* -> *Routing* -> *IPv4 Rules* -> *Add*.
    4. Choose `main` table & in *Advanced Settings* tab, enter `0x100` in *Firewall mark* and `3276` in *Priority*.

    - TODO

2. Edit your VPN configuration in *Network* -> *Interface* -> *Edit* next to the VPN interface and select one of the `BYP` tables in *Advanced Settings* tab -> *Override IPv4 routing table* (as well as IPv6 if used), there are 10 presets. 
3. Add an IP rule by going to *Network* -> *Routing* -> *IPv4 Rules* -> *Add* button.
4. Enter your LAN IP range in *Source*, by default it is `172.17.17.0/24` and select the `BYP` table you chose earlier.
5. Add a static route by going to *Network* -> *Routing* -> *Static IPv4 Routes* -> *Add* button.
6. Choose `lan` in *Interface* and enter your LAN IP range in *Target*, by default it is `172.17.17.0/24` and select the `BYP` table you chose earlier in *Advanced Settings* tab.
7. *Save and Apply*, confirm that your IP address has changed from the bypassed clients.
8. Done! For IPv6 users, you will have to use MAC addresses instead (TODO: Guide).

To tunnel specific clients/IP addresses to the VPN, treat the VPN interface as a WAN, and follow the steps in [Bypass clients to a specific WAN](wanbyp.md) instead of this guide.

Never share the same routing table number `BYP` with other WANs/VPNs.
Note that some VPN providers throttle multi-hop/cascading setups.
